# SECOND DESKTOP
&ensp;The Second Desktop is a toolbox, it will make your work more comfortable.  
&ensp;The Windows Start Menu is a collection of application shortcuts, it is quick and also stupid.  
&ensp;I think everyone has experienced the following operations:
&ensp;&ensp;-If you want to edit enviment.  
&ensp;&ensp;-If you want to edit Registry.  
&ensp;&ensp;-If you want to open folder,just like c:/a/b/c/d.
