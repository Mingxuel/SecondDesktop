# SECOND DESKTOP

&ensp;The Second Desktop is a toolbox, it will make your work more comfortable.
&ensp;The Windows Start Menu is a collection of application shortcuts, it is quick and also stupid.  
&ensp;Maybe you have such a story on your body:  
&ensp;&ensp;One day my manager give me a project, I found this project modify environment variables frequently.So every day I need to open the "Control Panel",then click "System and Security",then click "System", then click "Advanced system settings", then click "Environment Variables".That`s ok, because I think I just need to keep open the window all day long and through those steps once a day.
&ensp;&ensp;BUT! BUT! 
&ensp;&ensp;My f**king second finger and my obsessive heart command me close the window everytime.So i have to run the f**king steps all day long.  
&ensp;&ensp;Finally, I'm tired of it, so I developed easy-environment tool,yeah,that`s so easy, I just need click app and open, the environment that what i needs will shown to me,those are easier edit, I loved this tool so much, and this makes me proud.  
&ensp;&ensp;And another problem happened, the project need me to edit Registry, yeah, that`s not hard, i just need keydown win+R, and input regedit, and the Registry Editor will be opened,but the f**king path...  
&ensp;&ensp;I think you know the story, yes, i developed easy-registry, the registry that what i needs will shown to me,those are easier edit, I loved this tool so much, and this makes me proud.  
&ensp;&ensp;And the another day, I found i need copy some files to another folders. Shit! I`m a senior engineer!I don`t waste my time to do this,so, yes , i developed easy-copy, the files those what i needs will shown to me,those are easier copy, I loved this tool so much, and this makes me proud.  
&ensp;&ensp;And the another day... ...  
&ensp;&ensp;Finally, I developed thirteen tools. I need open the thirteen tools everymorning, and my f**king second finger and my obsessive heart command me close the tools everytime.Itâ€™s ironic!I waste many times to develop the "easy" tools, but finally, those make me like an idiot!  
&ensp;&ensp;I fell into meditation, I`m thinking, why don't I put these together?Even my f**king second finger and my obsessive heart command me close the tools everytime, I just need click once, then the thirteen easy tools will open.That`s right!  
&ensp;&ensp;So i developed this tool,named "Second Desktop".  
&ensp;&ensp;-If you want to edit Registry.  
&ensp;&ensp;-If you want to open folder,just like c:/a/b/c/d.
